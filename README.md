## Introduction

Ethics in engineering is not just about following regulations; it’s about making decisions that protect the public and contribute to the greater good. As engineers, our work impacts everything from safety to the environment, and we must make decisions that are both technically sound and ethically responsible.  

In this project, we’ll explore **ethical decision-making** using real-world scenarios and the development of a **personal ethical code** that guides how we approach these decisions.

## Ethical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Trolley Problem

In this scenario, you must choose whether to divert a runaway trolley to a track that will kill one person or keep it on the track that will kill five people. This scenario explores **utilitarianism** versus **deontological ethics**, posing the question of whether it is acceptable to sacrifice one life to save many.

- **Option 1:** Divert the trolley to the track with one person.
- **Option 2:** Keep the trolley on its current track, causing the death of five people.

**Reflection:**  
This scenario highlights the ethical tension between saving the most lives and the moral implications of actively choosing who lives or dies. As engineers, we often face similar decisions where the **public good** must be weighed against individual safety or rights.

### Scenario 2: Bribery in Construction

You are a civil engineer overseeing the construction of a building. A contractor offers you a bribe to use cheaper, unsafe materials for the ground floor columns. If you refuse, you’ll be fired.

- **Option 1:** Accept the bribe and compromise safety for financial gain.
- **Option 2:** Refuse the bribe, risking your job but upholding safety standards.

**Reflection:**  
This scenario emphasizes the importance of **integrity** and the duty engineers have to prioritize safety and public well-being over personal gain.

## Your Personal Code of Ethics

As an engineer, my ethical code serves as a guide for how I will make decisions that balance **technical expertise** with a commitment to **public good**. Below is a summary of the ethical principles that I aim to uphold in my career:

- **Integrity**: Always prioritize honesty, transparency, and accountability in my work.
- **Public Safety**: Never compromise on safety, even if it means personal or professional loss.
- **Sustainability**: Strive to create solutions that are environmentally sustainable and socially responsible.
- **Inclusivity**: Ensure that my work benefits people from all walks of life, particularly underserved communities.
- **Ethical Advocacy**: Stand up for ethical practices, even if it means challenging authority or popular opinion.

## Interactive Ethical Games

Explore the **ethical dilemmas** through interactive games. Try to make decisions in real-time and see the consequences of your choices.

- **Trolley Problem Simulation**: Make your decision on the trolley problem and watch how your choice impacts the outcome.
- **Workplace Ethics Game**: Play as a civil engineer deciding whether to accept or refuse a bribe from a contractor.

These games are designed to help you understand the complexities of ethical decision-making in engineering.

## Reflection & Learning

Throughout this project, I have learned that engineering ethics is not just about following codes of conduct; it’s about making thoughtful, responsible decisions that affect both the public and the environment. Some of the key takeaways include:

- **Ethical decision-making** requires not just technical knowledge but a deep understanding of social responsibility.
- Engineers must often balance **personal values** with **societal needs** and **corporate pressures**.
- The importance of having a **personal code of ethics** that guides everyday decisions in the workplace.

By applying these principles, I hope to contribute to a future where engineering innovations are made with integrity and for the greater good.
